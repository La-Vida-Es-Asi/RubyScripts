# RubyScripts
Just some small Ruby scripts used for testing purposes

I'm a Software QA Engineer and spare-time coding enthusiast.  I've been looking for ways to automate some of the things that I do and what better way to do that than to use Ruby to do some scripting.  The original files are very tailored to my own work-needs, but I've tried to make them a lot more general before I put them here so that I could at least provide examples for anyone out there wanting to script but not knowing quite where to start.  Hope it helps.  :)
